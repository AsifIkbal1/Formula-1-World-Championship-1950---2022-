Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2022)
In this project I will be trying to do some basic analysis with the Formula One data to test by skills in Python data analysis which I have been learning over the past month. Being an Formula One fan I thought working with the huge amount of data from this sport would be enjoyable. I will be using the F1 dataset "Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2022)" which is available in Kaggle.
